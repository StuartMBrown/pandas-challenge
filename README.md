MEMO TO THE SUPERINTENDENT OF URBOPOLIS PUBLIC SCHOOLS

The data show that our charter schools demonstrate significantly higher proficiency than our district schools, and more consistently produce proficient alumni; while our district schools do fairly in math proficiency and commendably in reading proficiency, our charter schools are much further ahead in dual proficiency. There are two aspects of my findings that I feel we should consider for the next school year.

-Firstly, per capita spending does not correlate with improved school performance, and there is in fact a negative correlation in terms of dual proficiency. It is critical that we detect what such factors are at play such that our district schools, despite receiving more money per student, are turning out less proficient alumni.

-Secondly, despite smaller class size being ideal, our medium-sized schools demonstrate better dual proficiency than our small-sized schools. As with our per capita spending, this warrants a study on what our mid-size schools are doing better on.

I anticipate my findings will be most appreciated at next week's board meeting. Please contact me about any questions.
